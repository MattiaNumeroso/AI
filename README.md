# Welcome to My AI Repo! 

Hi everyone! :)  

This is the place where I’m going to collect all my little experiments, projects, and explorations in the world of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Bioinformatics**.  

So here you’ll find a mix of them.

The idea behind this repository is simple: **play, learn, experiment, and share**. Nothing here is perfect, but everything here is real code I’ve written myself to understand concepts better and see them in action.  

Feel free to explore, fork, or just take inspiration. I’ll be updating this repository regularly with new projects, notes, and experiments.
